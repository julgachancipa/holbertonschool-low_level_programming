Holberton teaches full-stack software engineering with a project-based approach.
The first part of our on-site intensive education covers the foundations of software
engineering, including low-level programming, DevOps, and high-level modern languages.

This project is part of *low-level programming*, where you will understand how programming languages and Unix systems work, “what is going
on under the hood”. This will allow you to optimize and debug anything later in your career.
You will be working with algorithms and data structures which are essential foundations
for any great Software Engineer, the type that the best companies want to hire.
